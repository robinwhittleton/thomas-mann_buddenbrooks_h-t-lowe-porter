			<p>And now came, in two great cut-glass dishes, the “Plettenpudding.” It was made of layers of macaroons, raspberries, ladyfingers, and custard. At the same time, at the other end of the table, appeared the blazing plum-pudding which was the children’s favourite sweet.</p>
			<p>“Thomas, my son, come here a minute,” said Johann Buddenbrook, taking his great bunch of keys from his trousers pocket. “In the second cellar to the right, the second bin, behind the red Bordeaux, two bottles⁠—you understand?” Thomas, to whom such orders were familiar, ran off and soon came back with the two bottles, covered with dust and cobwebs; and the little dessert-glasses were filled with sweet, golden-yellow malmsey from these unsightly receptacles. Now the moment came when Pastor Wunderlich rose, glass in hand, to propose a toast; and the company fell silent to listen. He spoke in the pleasant, conversational tone which he liked to use in the pulpit; his head a little on one side, a subtle, humorous smile on his pale face, gesturing easily with his free hand. “Come, my honest friends, let us honour ourselves by drinking a glass of this excellent liquor to the health of our host and hostess in their beautiful new home. Come, then⁠—to the health of the Buddenbrook family, present and absent! May they live long and prosper!”</p>
			<p>“Absent?” thought the Consul to himself, bowing as the company lifted their glasses. “Is he referring to the Frankfort Buddenbrooks, or perhaps the Duchamps in Hamburg⁠—or did old Wunderlich really mean something by that?” He stood up and clinked glasses with his father, looking him affectionately in the eye.</p>
			<p>Broker Gratjens got up next, and his speech was rather long-winded; he ended by proposing in his high-pitched voice a health to the firm of Johann Buddenbrook, that it might continue to grow and prosper and do honour to the town.</p>
			<p>Johann Buddenbrook thanked them all for their kindness, first as head of the family and then as senior partner of the firm⁠—and sent Thomas for another bottle of Malmsey. It had been a mistake to suppose that two would be enough.</p>
			<p>Lebrecht Kröger spoke too. He took the liberty of remaining seated, because it looked less formal, and gestured with his head and hands most charmingly as he proposed a toast to the two ladies of the family, Madame Antoinette and the Frau Consul. As he finished, the Plettenpudding was nearly consumed, and the Malmsey nearing its end; and then, to a universal, long-drawn “Ah-h!” Jean Jacques Hoffstede rose up slowly, clearing his throat. The children clapped their hands with delight.</p>
			<p>“<i xml:lang="fr">Excusez!</i> I really couldn’t help it,” he began. He put his finger to his long sharp nose and drew a paper from his coat pocket.⁠ ⁠… A profound silence reigned throughout the room.</p>
			<p>His paper was gaily parti-coloured. On the outside of it was written, in an oval border surrounded by red flowers and a profusion of gilt flourishes:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p>“On the occasion of my friendly participation in a delightful housewarming party given by the Buddenbrook family. <time datetime="1835-10">October 1835</time>.”</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>He read this aloud first; then turning the paper over, he began, in a voice that was already somewhat tremulous:</p>
			<blockquote epub:type="z3998:poem">
				<p>
					<span>Honoured friends, my modest lay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Hastes to greet you in these walls:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>May kind Heaven grant today</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blessing on their spacious halls.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Thee, my friend with silver hair,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And thy faithful, loving spouse,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And your children young and fair⁠—</span>
					<br/>
					<span>I salute you, and your house.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Industry and beauty chaste</span>
					<br/>
					<span>See we linked in marriage band:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Venus Anadyomene</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cunning Vulcan’s busy hand.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>May no future storms dismay</span>
					<br/>
					<span>With unkind blast the joyful hour;</span>
					<br/>
					<span>May each new returning day</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Blessings on your pathway shower.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>Ceaselessly shall I rejoice</span>
					<br/>
					<span>O’er the fortune that is yours:</span>
					<br/>
					<span>As today I lift my voice,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>May I still, while life endures.</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					<span>In your splendid walls live well,</span>
					<br/>
					<span>And cherish with affection true</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Him who in his humble cell</span>
					<br/>
					<span>Penned today these lines for you</span>
				</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>He bowed to a unanimous outburst of applause.</p>
			<p>“Charming, Hoffstede,” cried old Buddenbrook. “It was too charming for words. I drink your health.”</p>
			<p>But when the Frau Consul touched glasses with the poet, a delicate blush mantled her cheek; for she had seen the courtly bow he made in her direction when he came to the part about the Venus Anadyomene.</p>
