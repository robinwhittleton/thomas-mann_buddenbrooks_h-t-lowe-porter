			<p>“It is wonderful how one doesn’t get bored, here at the seashore, Morten. Imagine lying anywhere else for hours at a time, flat on your back, doing nothing, not even thinking⁠—”</p>
			<p>“Yes. But I must confess that I used to be bored sometimes⁠—only not in the last few weeks.”</p>
			<p>Autumn was at hand. The first strong wind had risen. Thin, tattered grey clouds raced across the sky. The dreary, tossing sea was covered far and wide with foam. Great, powerful waves rolled silently in, relentless, awesome; towered majestically, in a metallic dark-green curve, then crashed thundering on the sand.</p>
			<p>The season was quite at an end. On that part of the beach usually occupied by the throng of bathers, the pavilions were already partly dismantled, and it lay as quiet as the grave, with only a very few basket-chairs. But Tony and Morten spent the afternoon in a distant spot, at the edge of the yellow loam, where the waves hurled their spray as far up as Seagull Rock. Morten had made her a solid sand fortress, and she leaned against it with her back, her feet in their strap shoes and white stockings crossed in front of her. Morten lay turned toward her, his chin in his hands. Now and then a seagull flew past them, shrieking. They looked at the green wall of wave, streaked with seaweed, that came threateningly on and on and then broke against the opposing boulders, with the eternal, confused tumult that deafens and silences and destroys all sense of time.</p>
			<p>Finally Morten made a movement as though rousing himself from deep thought, and said, “Well, you will soon be leaving us, Fräulein Tony.”</p>
			<p>“No; why?” Tony said absently.</p>
			<p>“Well, it is the <time datetime="09-10">tenth of September</time>. My holidays are nearly at an end, anyhow. How much longer can it last? Shall you be glad to get back to the society of your own kind? Tell me⁠—I suppose the gentlemen you dance with are very agreeable?⁠—No, no, that was not what I wanted to say. Now you must answer me,” he said, with a sudden resolution, shifting his chin in his hands and looking at her. “Here is the question I have been waiting so long to ask. Now: who is Herr Grünlich?”</p>
			<p>Tony sat up, looking at him quickly, her eyes shifting back and forth like those of a person recollecting himself on coming out of a dream. She was feeling again the sense of increased personal importance first experienced when Herr Grünlich proposed for her hand.</p>
			<p>“Oh, is that what you want to know, Morten?” she said weightily. “Well, I will tell you. It was really very painful for me to have Thomas mention his name like that, the first afternoon; but since you have already heard of him⁠—well, Herr Grünlich, Bendix Grünlich, is a business friend of my father, a well-to-do Hamburg merchant, who has asked for my hand. No, no,” she replied quickly to a movement of Morten’s, “I have refused him; I have never been able to make up my mind to yield him my consent for life.”</p>
			<p>“And why not?⁠—if I may ask,” said Morten awkwardly.</p>
			<p>“Why? Oh, good heavens, because I couldn’t endure him,” she cried out in a passion. “You ought to have seen him, how he looked and how he acted. Among other things, he had yellow whiskers⁠—dreadfully unnatural. I’m sure he curled them and put on gold powder, like the stuff we use for the Christmas nuts. And he was underhanded. He fawned on my Father and Mother and chimed in with them in the most shameful way⁠—”</p>
			<p>Morten interrupted her. “But what does this mean: ‘That trims it up uncommonly.’ ”</p>
			<p>Tony broke into a nervous giggle.</p>
			<p>“Well, he talked like that, Morten. He wouldn’t say ‘That looks very well’ or ‘It goes very well with the room.’ He was frightfully silly, I tell you. And very persistent; he simply wouldn’t be put off, although I never gave him anything but sarcasm. Once he made such a scene⁠—he nearly wept⁠—imagine a man weeping!”</p>
			<p>“He must have worshipped you,” Morten said softly.</p>
			<p>“Well, what affair was that of mine?” she cried out, astonished, turning around on her sand-heap.</p>
			<p>“You are cruel, Fräulein Tony. Are you always cruel? Tell me: You didn’t like this Herr Grünlich. But is there anyone to whom you have been more gracious? Sometimes I think: Has she a cold heart? Let me tell you something: a man is not idiotic simply because he weeps when you won’t look at him. I swear it. I am not sure, not at all, that I wouldn’t do the same thing. You see, you are such a dainty, spoilt thing. Do you always make fun of people that lie at your feet? Have you really a cold heart?”</p>
			<p>After the first giggle, Tony’s lip began to quiver. She turned on him a pair of great distressed eyes, which slowly filled with tears as she said softly: “No, Morten, you should not think that of me⁠—you must not think that of me.”</p>
			<p>“I don’t; indeed I don’t,” he cried, with a laugh of mingled emotion and hardly suppressed exultation. He turned fully about, so that he lay supporting himself on his elbows, took her hands in both his, and looked straight into hers with his kind steel-blue eyes, which were excited and dreamy and exalted all at once.</p>
			<p>“Then you⁠—you won’t mock at me if I tell you⁠—?”</p>
			<p>“I know, Morten,” she answered gently, looking away from him at the fine white sand sifting through the fingers of her free hand.</p>
			<p>“You know⁠—and you⁠—oh, Fräulein Tony!”</p>
			<p>“Yes, Morten. I care a great deal for you. More than for anyone else I know.”</p>
			<p>He started up, making awkward gestures with his arms, like a man bewildered. Then he got to his feet, only to throw himself down again by her side and cry in a voice that stammered, wavered, died away and rose again, out of sheer joy: “Oh, thank you, thank you! I am so happy! more than I ever was in all my life!” And he fell to kissing her hands. After a moment he said more quietly; “You will be going back to town soon, Tony, and my holidays will be over in two weeks; then I must return to Göttingen. But will you promise me that you will never forget this afternoon here on the beach⁠—till I come back again with my degree, and can ask your Father⁠—however hard that’s going to be? And you won’t listen to any Herr Grünlich meantime? Oh, it won’t be so long⁠—I will work like a⁠—like anything! it will be so easy!”</p>
			<p>“Yes, Morten,” she said dreamily, looking at his eyes, his mouth, his hands holding hers.</p>
			<p>He drew her hand close to his breast and asked very softly and imploringly: “And won’t you⁠—may I⁠—seal the promise?”</p>
			<p>She did not answer, she did not look at him, but moved nearer to him on the sand-heap, and Morten kissed her slowly and solemnly on the mouth. Then they stared in different directions across the sand, and both felt furiously embarrassed.</p>
